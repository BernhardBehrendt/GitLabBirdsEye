This is a tool to get a birds eye view on your GitLab projects, hence the name BirdsEye.
This does not need any installation, since it is an angular application that runs in your browser.
Just open index.html.

known issues
============
- This currently only works in Firefox, since other browsers block the loading of templates, when run from the file system.
  However, if you set up a local web server or disable that restriction e.g. via chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files,
  this should also work on other browsers.

- When opening or closing a project panel, the view scrolls to the top. No idea how to fix that.
