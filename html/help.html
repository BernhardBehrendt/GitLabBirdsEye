        <h4>Authorization</h4>
        <p>
            Authorization works with the <strong>GitLab private token</strong>. It identifies and authenticates you.
            You can get your private token by checking your account setting (/profile/account) on GitLab.
            You'll have to paste this token into the config.js file.
        </p>
        <p>
            The private token is a secret token,
            so don't put the config.js with your token into a version control system or something similar.

        <h4>What ist this all about, anyways?</h4>
        <p>
            BirdsEye is a tool that gives you a birds eys view over GitLab projects. It is designed to assist in a
            standard three branch workflow and lists projects with unmerged commits between develop, release and
            master branches.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can quickly identify projects that should or could get merge requests, take a look at commits that
            could be merged and actually create merge requests.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>View changes and create merge requests</h4>
        <p>
            The right side of a project panel shows the standard branch setup with develop, release and master.
            The green circles show the number of commits that are in the left, but not in the right branch. You can
            click on such a circle to create a merge request. If a merge request already exists, a small icon is shown
            on the circles right side and a link to all merge requests appears on the right side of the project panel.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also click on the arrow on the far right side of a project panel to open a list of the
            individual commits. Clicking on a commit title will bring you to the commits GitLab page and clicking
            on the commit authors name will open a new email to them with some information about the commit already
            in place.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Did you know?</h4>
        <p>
            You can hover over many elements for one second to get a tooltip explaining what it does.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can click on a commit authors name to write them an email that already contains information
            about and a link to the referenced commit.
